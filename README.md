If anyone knows, how to have the same functionality with less code, please let me know.  
I know that it should (and i think) can be written with less code, but this was the fastest way to finish it, and i wanted to finish it fast, and not work on it for a week

I left the java file, i used to create the command in javascript (because i didn't wanna copy paste everything)  
in the directory, if someone is interested in it.
